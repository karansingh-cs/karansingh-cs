ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Karan.

I'm a Software developer and a student pursuing Bachelor degree in Computer Science ðŸ¤“

My areas of greatest strength are in Java, C++ and web development - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript. I enjoy building applications that revolve around helping people make effective use of their time, maintain a routine, expand the limits of focus-work and aid them in pursuing a productive and meaningful life. I am currently working on a webapp that is geared towards simplifying the life domains. 

Currently I'm learning React
