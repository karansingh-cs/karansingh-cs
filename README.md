ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Karan.

A software engineer currently based in Kansas City. I bring extensive experience in application development, specializing in technologies such as C#, .NET, ASP.NET, C++, MFC and more. I'm an aspiring programmer who is always excited about the opportunities to engineer technologies, to learn and enhance my skillset.

In my current Software Engineer role, I am focused on developing powerful and responsive desktop applications with rich user interfaces. I leverage my expertise in C++ and MFC to develop feature-rich and performance-critical applications, including multi-document applications with MFC modal and modeless dialog boxes.

Previously, during my internship at Moonshot Solutions, I played a key role in the development of an online nurse staffing tool using C# .NET, ASP.NET, and Visual Basic. I contributed to significant cost savings for the company by implementing Azure functions with Azure BLOB storage, resulting in a 15% decrease in database expenses. Additionally, I collaborated with a team of developers to automate offline SQL jobs and integrate them into scheduled Azure Functions and MVC functions.
