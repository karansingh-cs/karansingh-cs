ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Karan.

A software engineer with extensive experience in full-stack application development, specializing in C#, .NET Core, SQL, React, and Azure technologies. As an aspiring programmer, I am passionate about learning new skills, and continuously enhancing my technical expertise.

In my current Software Engineer role, I work with C++, MFC, C# .NET Core, and SQL to develop performance-critical applications with rich user interfaces. I focus on creating robust desktop applications that meet the needs of the business while leveraging my technical skills for efficiency and performance.

Additionally, Iâ€™ve worked on side projects and currently working project - the Pickleball Tournament Organizer, a full-stack web application using React.js and ASP.NET Core. This project involves managing player registration, match scheduling, and real-time updates, showcasing my full-stack capabilities outside of my primary role.

Previously, during my internship at Moonshot Solutions, I contributed to the development of an online nurse staffing tool using C# .NET, ASP.NET, and Visual Basic. I helped implement Azure Functions with Azure BLOB storage, resulting in a 15% decrease in database expenses. Additionally, I worked with a team to automate SQL jobs and integrate them into scheduled Azure Functions, enhancing the toolâ€™s efficiency.
